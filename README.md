## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze the 2024 Developer Survey dataset and answer key business questions, such as:
- What are the most popular programming languages and tools?
- Which countries have the largest developer communities?
- What factors influence developers' interest in AI tools?

## Key Questions
1. **What are the most popular programming languages and tools?**
2. **Which countries have the largest developer communities?**
3. **What factors influence developers' interest in AI tools?**

## Findings
- **JavaScript**, **Python**, and **Docker** are the most popular technologies.
- The **United States**, **India**, and **Germany** have the largest developer populations.
- **developers** those with **25-34 years** are most interested in AI tools.
